# unusable_player
Unusable Player is a flutter music player based on just_audio package.
It's a portfolio project, it's not meant to be used in real life.
Its focuses on visuals instead of usability and performance, that's why the project is called "Unusable Player".

# Caution
This project isn't representative of my actual coding standards.
If you take inspiration from this source code, keep a critical eye. Some parts of this project are better than others.
If I should restart this project today, I would:
- Use Bloc instead of GetX
- Use a feature-based project organization
- Re-write the animations widgets to make them less hacky
- Rethink the overall songs discovery and player architecture
In short, almost everything. It was a nice learning project, I will finish it but I do not plan to start working on a v2.0.
